# Question: How do you count palindromic substrings in a given string? C# Summary

The provided C# code counts the number of palindromic substrings in a given string. The program first prompts the user to enter a string. It then calls the `CountPalindromicSubstrings` method, which uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. This method creates a 2D boolean array, `dp`, where `dp[i, j]` is `true` if the substring from index `i` to `j` in the input string is a palindrome. It iterates over the string, checking for palindromes of increasing length. For a single character, it is always a palindrome. For two characters, it checks if they are the same. For strings of length greater than 2, it checks if the first and last characters are the same and if the substring between them is a palindrome (which it knows from the previously filled `dp` array). If the substring is a palindrome, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count, which is the total number of palindromic substrings in the input string.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution uses a different approach to solve the problem compared to the C# version. 

In the C# version, a dynamic programming approach is used to count the palindromic substrings. It uses a 2D boolean array (dp) to keep track of whether a substring is palindromic or not. It iterates over the string in a way that it first checks all substrings of length 1, then of length 2, and so on. For each substring, it checks if the first and last characters are the same and if the substring between these two characters is also a palindrome (which it gets from the dp array). If these conditions are met, it marks the substring as a palindrome in the dp array and increments the count.

On the other hand, the Python version uses a different approach where it considers every possible center for the palindrome and expands on both sides for longer palindromes. It counts a palindrome for every successful expansion. This approach does not require any extra space like the dp array in the C# version.

In terms of language features, the Python version uses floor division (//) and modulus (%) operators to calculate the left and right pointers for each possible center. It also uses the `input()` function to get user input and the `print()` function to display the result, which are equivalent to `Console.ReadLine()` and `Console.WriteLine()` in C#. The Python version also uses the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct to allow or prevent parts of code from being run when the modules are imported.

# Java Differences

Both the C# and Java versions of the solution use the same logic to solve the problem. They both use a dynamic programming approach to count the number of palindromic substrings in a given string. They create a 2D boolean array (dp) to store whether a substring is a palindrome or not. They iterate over the string and for each substring, they check if it is a palindrome and increment a counter if it is.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences in syntax and standard libraries between the two languages:

1. Input Reading: In C#, the Console.ReadLine() method is used to read the input string from the console. In Java, a Scanner object is created and the nextLine() method is used to read the input string.

2. Array Declaration: In C#, the syntax for declaring a 2D array is new bool[n, n]. In Java, the syntax is new boolean[n][n].

3. Character Access: In C#, characters in a string are accessed like an array (s[i]). In Java, the charAt() method is used to access characters in a string (s.charAt(i)).

4. Console Output: In C#, the Console.WriteLine() method is used to print the output to the console. In Java, System.out.println() is used.

5. Method Visibility: In C#, the method CountPalindromicSubstrings is declared as static, meaning it belongs to the Program class and not to any instance of the class. In Java, the method countPalindromicSubstrings is declared as private static, meaning it can only be accessed within the Main class.
